Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. 
From imposing São Jorge Castle, the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, 
Tagus Estuary and Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. 
Nearby, the National Azulejo Museum displays 5 centuries of decorative ceramic tiles. 
Just outside Lisbon is a string of Atlantic beaches, from Cascais to Estoril.

Lisbon, Portuguese Lisboa, city, port, capital of Portugal, and 
the centre of the Lisbon metropolitan area. Located in western Portugal 
on the estuary of the Tagus (Tejo) River, it is the westernmost capital 
city in continental Europe and serves as the country’s chief port, largest city, and 
commercial, political, and tourist centre.

Lisbon is probably best known for its colonialist history, 
ornate architecture and tradition of Fado music. 
But some of its best features are in the everyday – 
spectacular hilltop vistas in Alfama or at St. George's Castle, 
pleasant year-round weather and friendly locals.
