
The northern suburb of Fajã de Cima is famous for festivals, 
so if the timing is right it's worth a visit. 
And it's also a good idea, having explored the city centre on foot, 
to take a short trip out into the stunning and lush natural surroundings that 
typify the rest of São Miguel, not least the nearby Sete Cidades mountains and lake.


Ponta Delgada, on São Miguel Island, is the capital of the Azores archipelago of Portugal. The striking, 3-arched city gates and the Gothic-style Church of St. Sebastian are near the harbor. The Convent and Chapel of Our Lady of Hope houses a revered image of Christ. The Carlos Machado Museum offers diverse artifacts of Azorean culture. The city is a gateway to the crater lakes of Sete Cidades, to the northwest.
